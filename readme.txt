JS files related to a HTML file moved to JS folder.
All HTML files with references to a JS file changed to point to right location.
Changed classGuest.js from guest to Guest with a capital.
Removed all style.css files and added 1 to styling folder.
Moved checkbox info to Misc folder
Styling still in the works. (Don't Panic Gijs :P)

Started on JS module that will contain functions which
can be used from all html files like the fancy label appearing on input.
